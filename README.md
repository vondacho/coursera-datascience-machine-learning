# Human activity recognition

This project applies human activity recognition to the weightlifting domain. Six participants taught by a professional and equiped with measurement captors were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

Machine learning is used to build a model from a dataset of measurements provisioned by the set of captors installed on the participants, and to classify the correctness of the same exercises executed by anyone without the support of a professional of the domain. The measure of correctness or the outcome of the predictions is given by the class category variable which values belong to the enumeration A,B,C,D and E.
